**Developed by Forex Robot Easy Team**

Forex Robot Easy is not the official developer of this product. We only provide a sample code that can work as described in this product. To find the official developer of this product, please refer to MQL5.

## Product Description

Promex MT5 is a high probability forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to perform market analysis and identify trading opportunities with a success probability of 95% or higher.

The software utilizes various calculations and indicators to determine the price deviation from its normal value and calculate the success probability for a potential trade. When the probability exceeds 95%, the software automatically opens a trade and sets a trailing stop to accumulate profits from the market.

## How it Works

The software follows a simple workflow to identify high-probability trading opportunities:

1. **Initialization:** The necessary variables and settings are initialized during the Expert initialization function.

2. **Market Analysis:** The OnTick() function is triggered for every tick in the market. Inside this function, the software performs market analysis using the CalculatePriceDeviation() and CalculateNormalValue() functions. It calculates the price deviation from its normal value and determines the normal value of the price.

3. **Success Probability Calculation:** The CalculateSuccessProbability() function is used to calculate the success probability based on the price deviation and normal value. The exact calculation method is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

4. **Opening a Trade:** If the calculated probability exceeds 0.95 (95%), the OpenTrade() function is called to open a trade based on the identified high-probability trading opportunity. The implementation of opening a trade is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

5. **Setting a Trailing Stop:** After opening a trade, the SetTrailingStop() function is called to set a trailing stop. This allows the software to accumulate a small profit from the market while protecting the trade from potential losses. The implementation of setting a trailing stop is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.
